  <div class="content"> My name is Will, and I am from the US. I spent a four year period in my teenage years in Mexico, where I would mainly become interested in music -although I had played the violin for about two years already. In Mexico I would be a part of a few highschool bands and one professional one named Debrided. I play the bass guitar, drums, harmonica, violin, and have fairly versatile vocals.</div>
