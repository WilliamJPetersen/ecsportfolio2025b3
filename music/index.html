  <div class="content"> My name is Will, and I am from the US. I spent a four year period in my teenage years in Mexico, where I would mainly become interested in music -although I had played the violin for about two years already. In Mexico I would be a part of a few highschool bands and one professional one named Debrided. I play the bass guitar, drums, harmonica, melodica, violin, and have fairly versatile vocals. I play many different styles depending on the project, like hardcore beatdown, indie pop, and classic rock, although presently progressive rock and hard rock call to me. My musical inspirations would be traced to the Talking Heads, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rush, and Of Montreal, among others.</p>

	<h3>Live Shows</h3>
	<p> Throughout the years, I have played several shows and concerts with the different groups I've been with. To the side are some images of the shows I've played:

	<h3>Achievements And Advancements</h3>
	<p>Throughout my musical career, I have produced several songs under different projects. Although none are at the moment published, I play on an album by Debrided, a single by the Paracosmos, write and play all instruments on an anonymous project, and sing on Morsel Grind. I am also a member of the Skyline Orchestra. In my shows, I've played in many positions and have established myself as a proficient simultanious lead singer and drummer and lead singer and bassist. I first picked up the violin in 2020, and would play it primarily until 2022 when I began playing drums. In late 2023 I would begin playing the bass as well. Since then, I have become competent with all three instruments. </p>
