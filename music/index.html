  <div class="content"> My name is Will, and I am from the US. I spent a four year period in my teenage years in Mexico, where I would mainly become interested in music -although I had played the violin for about two years already. In Mexico I would be a part of a few highschool bands and one professional one named Debrided. I play the bass guitar, drums, harmonica, violin, and have fairly versatile vocals. I play many different styles depending on the project, like hardcore beatdown, indie pop, and classic rock, although presently progressive rock and hard rock call to me. My musical inspirations would be traced to the Talking Heads, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rush, and Of Montreal, among others.</div>
